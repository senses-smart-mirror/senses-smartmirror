# Contributing to Senses - Smart Mirror
We appreciate your help! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Track project status on the project board.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests and decide the project plan / status on the project board.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
So all code changes happen through Pull Requests;
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation [repo here]().
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

Please consider meaningfull commit messages and use the following types:

- **feat**: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- **fix**: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- **docs**: (changes to the documentation)
- **style**: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- **refactor**: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- **test**: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- **chore**: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues]()
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
In order to have consistend issue reports please follow the following guidelines.

1. Please make sure there is no related issue open already.
2. See issue template.
3. Open new issue and fill out the tempalte.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Order the steps
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- Are you using any other libraries or modules

We *love* thorough bug reports. With good reports we can help you faster!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Please use the editor config file.

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
